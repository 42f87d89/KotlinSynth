# KotlinSynth
A synth you can play with your computer keyboard in a janko style layout.

This synth is played with your computer keyboard, the notes are arranged into two pairs of isomorphic rows, one of the pairs being an octave higher.
The *Z* key is 440hz, moving horizontally equates to moving one equal tempered whole step, moving to the other row equates to moving one half-step.
Thus, a major scale starting at the *Z* key would be *Z X C F G H J M(or W)*

Right now you can only play sine waves. Eventually I would like for it to be more customizable.

To compile this project you will need LWJGL and LWJGL_GLFW.
